Hi! I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Automation in The Shenzhen University(SZU). 
My research mainly focuses on understanding [the modern paradigms in generalization](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/modern-paradigms-generalization), using both theoretical and interpretability approaches.
I am going to pursue my MSc degree in Electrical Engineering. Feel free to reach out if you share the same interests.



<!-- ## Recent News -->


## Education
* BSc in Automation, Shenzhen University, 2025

## Research experience
* July 2024 ~ Ongoing: Research Internship
  * Supervised under Professor Wei Hu @ Michigan
  * Working on understanding in-context learning mechanism using clean and controlled setting

* July 2023 ~ Ongoing: Remote Collaboration
  * Supervised under Professor Yiping Lu @ Northwestern
  * Worked on benign overfitting for PINN, and had a first-authored paper under review
  * Organized the Deep Learning Theory Reading Group inside the research group

* Oct 2022 ~ Nov 2023: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) @ HKUST
  * Supervised under Professor Tong Zhang @ HKUST
  * [Paper accepted to ICLR2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17230) as coauthor
  * This work has an interesting finding that ensemble of models with spurious features can improve its performance, which is contrary to common belief on OOD that models should maintain invariant features and disgard spurious features like IRM. 
  * (Here begins my research journey! Very thankful to Yong Lin, Yifan Hao and Lu Tan for guiding me)
